#' Random Forest
#'
#' This function takes random forest feature list, dataset, leave one out value, a value for n-fold cross-validation and number of trees. Now, it outputs spearman correlation based on provided dataset.
#' @param featurelist a list of feature
#' @param featuredata provided dataset
#' @param leaveonegene 1 means this method will perform leave-one-out cross-validation; otherwise it will perform n-fold cross-validation
#' @param kfold a value for cross validation, by default it is set to 10
#' @param trees number of trees that are allowed to grow. default one is set to 500.
#' @return a vector of spearman correlations for all runs
#' @export
